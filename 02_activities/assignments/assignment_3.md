# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
       
## Good:

### Accessibility
The visualization is visually appealing and well-organized, making it easy to navigate. Clear color gradients and labeled sections help viewers quickly grasp population density and demographic trends. However, it heavily relies on colors that may not be suitable for colorblind users, and the small font size can make details hard to read. Interactivity is also missing, which limits its usability for users with disabilities.

### Reproducibility
The visualization cites credible data sources like the World Bank and Population Censuses, which supports its reliability. The use of standard visualization methods, such as hexagonal grids and line charts, makes it theoretically reproducible. However, it does not provide raw data, detailed processing steps, or code, which makes replication difficult for others.

### Equity
The visualization effectively highlights key demographic issues, including gender disparities and urban-rural population differences. However, it focuses heavily on urban areas like Seoul, potentially overlooking rural challenges. Socio-economic factors, which could provide a deeper understanding of inequality, are notably absent.

## Badï¼š

![Visualization: Spare Time Over a Lifetime](./2.png)

### Accessibility
- The heavy reliance on similar shades makes it hard for colorblind users to distinguish categories.
- The labels are small and often overlap, making them difficult to read in crowded sections.
- Itâ€™s a static visualization without interactivity or alternative formats for visually impaired users.

### Reproducibility
- Thereâ€™s no mention of where the data came from or how activities were measured.
- It doesnâ€™t explain how the categories were defined or how the time allocation was recorded.
- Without access to the tools or code, others canâ€™t replicate the visualization.

### Equity
- Terms like "Time Wasters" impose value judgments that might not apply to everyone.
- It fails to account for different cultural, social, or economic backgrounds, reducing its inclusiveness.
- The focus on one narrative excludes broader patterns or diversity.


----

 - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?
    ## Goodï¼š
    ### Accessibility
    - Use colorblind-friendly palettes and increase font size for better readability.
    - Add interactive features, such as zoom and tooltips, to make it accessible for a broader audience.

    ### Reproducibility
    - Provide raw datasets and include metadata for transparency.
    - Share detailed steps on data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.
      
    ### Equity
    - Expand focus to include rural areas and smaller cities, ensuring more balanced geographic coverage.
    - Add socio-economic data (income levels, resource access) to deepen insights into inequalities.
    - Involve local perspectives to ensure cultural and contextual relevance.


    ### Badï¼š
    ### Accessibility
    - Use a colorblind-friendly palette or add patterns to differentiate categories.
    - Introduce interactive features like tooltips or zooming for easier navigation.
    
    ### Reproducibility
    - Provide the raw data and clearly explain how activities were tracked and categorized.
    - Detail the methodology and tools used to create the visualization.
      
    ### Equity
    - Replace subjective terms like "Time Wasters" with neutral labels such as "Leisure Activities."
    - Include data from multiple individuals or demographic groups to make the visualization more inclusive.
    - Add a note explaining that the visualization reflects a personal narrative rather than generalized trends.


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
