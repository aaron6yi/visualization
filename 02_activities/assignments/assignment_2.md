# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      
      Good:
      ![South Korea Population Density & Demographics](./1.png)
      
      **Comprehensive Overview**  
       This visualization does a great job of presenting a broad range of demographic and population data in one place. It combines a population density map with key metrics like fertility rates,         life expectancy, and gender distribution, making it easy to assess trends and challenges quickly.
      
      **Clear Theme and Consistency**  
       Everything ties together under a clear theme: South Korea's population and demographics. The map and charts complement each other, creating a cohesive narrative that makes the data easy to         follow.
      
      **Visually Intuitive Design**  
       The use of colors on the density map is spot onâ€”it immediately draws attention to densely populated areas like Seoul. The gradient is well-designed, helping users quickly identify high and        low-density regions.
      
      **Context and Explanations**  
      The text annotations throughout the visualization provide helpful context, explaining key trends like declining birth rates and population changes. This makes the visualization not just           informative but also educational.

      **Effective Use of Charts**  
       The inclusion of various chart typesâ€”line charts, bar graphs, and population pyramidsâ€”ensures a well-rounded view of the data.



      



    - How could this data visualization have been improved?
      
   Good:
  
  **Add Interactivity**  
  Right now, the visualization is static. Adding interactive elementsâ€”like being able to hover over the map or charts to see detailed data pointsâ€”would make it much more engaging. For               example, hovering over a specific city or year could show exact population or fertility rate figures.

      
  **Provide Dynamic Filtering Options**
      
  Giving users the ability to filter data by time, region, or specific metrics (like focusing on gender distribution or adolescent fertility rates) would make the visualization more                 personalized and useful for deeper analysis.
  
      


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
